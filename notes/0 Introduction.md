## Quantum Computing

- Quantum computing is a new type of computing that uses quantum-mechanical phenomena, such as superposition and entanglement, to perform computations.
- Quantum computers are different from digital electronic computers based on transistors, which uses binary digits (bits) to represent information.
- Quantum computers use quantum bits (qubits) to represent information, which can be in a superposition of states and represent 0 and 1 at the same time.
- Quantum computers are expected to be able to solve certain computational problems much faster than any digital computer, and to solve some problems that are impossible for any digital computer to solve.
  - As of 2022, most traditional supercomputers are still faster than quantum computers. But, theoretically and hopefully in the future, Quantum computers will be much faster than traditional computers.

Interesting Fact:

With 20 qubits: there are a million possible outcomes.
With 100 qubits: you have more possibilities than there are bits in all the hard drives in the world.
With 300 qubits: thatâ€™s more possibilities than there are particles in the universe.

### Current State of Quantum Computers

- The first quantum computer was built in 1981 by Peter Shor at IBM.
- IBM's Eagle Processor is the largest research Quantum Computer in 2022 with 127 qubits.
- IonQ's Aria is the largest commercial Quantum Computer in 2022 with 20 qubits.

### Current Limitations of Quantum Computers

- Quantum computers are still in their infancy, and are not yet able to solve problems that are difficult for traditional computers.
- Quantum computers are still very noisy, which results in errors in the computation.
- Quantum computers require a lot of specialized hardware and software, which makes them expensive to build, maintain, and scale.
